# HARDBALL — Autonomous BML Log (working while GP signed off)

Each entry = one small Build-Measure-Learn cycle: what I built, what I
measured, what I learned, and where it shipped (commit). Everything below is
verified by a real command run, not self-asserted. GP review pending on all.

## Cycle 0 — poka-yoke bottom line
- Built: green "BOTTOM LINE (read this first)" box showing the takeaway +
  the single owner action (buy contact/OBP, not power) + why to trust it.
- Shipped: commit 671c824.
- Learn: dashboard had charts but no chart-agnostic takeaway; a non-expert
  could misread it. Fixed.

## Cycle 1 — is winning-cheap durable or a fluke? (2000-2024, n=721)
- Built: src/bml_cycle1.py — analyzed jeremyliao0411/mlb-payroll-wins
  df_final_merged.csv (721 MLB team-seasons 2000-2024, Lahman + public payroll).
- Measured: efficiency gradient is monotonic and durable — lowest payroll
  quartile wins 152/$100M vs top quartile 63/$100M across 25 years.
  BUT cheap teams win FEWER total wins (76.1 vs 87.3) — frugality ≠ winning.
- Learned: 'wins per $100M' rewards cheap-mediocre teams, NOT genuine
  winning-cheap outliers. The MIL/TB/CLE edge (95-103 wins at low cost) sits
  ABOVE the curve and is the real target. Sharpen the demo message from
  'be efficient' to 'be efficient AND competitive-plus.'
- Shipped: src/bml_cycle1.py pushed (commit pending).

## Cycle 2 — does team health (injury proxy) improve the wins model? → NO (honest negative)
- Built: src/bml_cycle2.py — pulled all player transactions 2025+2026 (17,968 +
  17,188 = 35k events archived to data/raw/), built team-season health proxy
  (IL placements + rehab assignments), joined to the hitting model.
- Measured: hitting-only CV MAE 7.29 wins vs hitting+health 7.31 — essentially
  flat, slightly worse. Health added NO predictive signal at team level.
- Learned: the literature says injury matters CONTEXT-SPECIFICALLY (oblique
  hurts hitters not pitchers; labral repair kills pitcher innings) — a blunt
  team-count of IL placements washes that out. Health belongs as a PLAYER-level
  projection adjustment (weighted by position/severity/recovery), not a
  team-wins feature. This is a validated negative result (Lean: learning what
  doesn't work). Raw 35k-event transaction archive retained for future use.
- Shipped: src/bml_cycle2.py, data/health_2025_2026.json, raw transactions.
